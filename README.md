# Clustering Analysis of Districts and Cities in The Island of Java as Targets of Motorcycle Industry

## Overview

This research addresses the shrinking motorcycle market on the Island of Java, Indonesia, where 87% of private vehicles are motorcycles and 80% of households already own one. To help the motorcycle industry find new growth opportunities, this study focuses on **clustering regencies and cities in Java based on their demographic characteristics.** The aim is to provide data-driven recommendations for motorcycle manufacturers to optimize their product focus and strategies.

## Problem Statement

The high saturation of motorcycles in Java (60% of Indonesia's total, with 80% household ownership) indicates a shrinking market for new motorcycle sales. This poses a long-term challenge for the motorcycle industry, which requires new strategies beyond traditional sales to sustain growth.

## Research Objectives

* To cluster regencies and cities in Java based on their demographic characteristics.
* To evaluate and determine the most suitable clustering method for this dataset.
* To provide actionable decision recommendations for the motorcycle industry based on the formed clusters.

## Methodology

This research employed a **partitional hard clustering method** using 12 demographic variables, categorized into:
1.  **Economic Conditions of Society**
2.  **Living Conditions of Society**
3.  **Demographic Conditions of the Region**

The key steps involved:
1.  **Dataset Creation:** Data scraping from trusted sources.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial analysis of the dataset.
3.  **Clustering:** Implementation of:
    * K-Means Clustering
    * K-Medoids Clustering
4.  **Cluster Evaluation:** Using four metrics to determine the best clustering method:
    * Silhouette Index
    * Dunn Index
    * Davies Bouldin Index
    * Calinski Harabasz Index

## Key Findings

The research found that the **K-Medoids Clustering method with 5 clusters** provided the most suitable grouping of regencies and cities in Java.

## Decision Recommendations for the Motorcycle Industry

Based on the 5 formed clusters, four distinct decision recommendations are provided:

1.  **Spare Parts Distribution:** Focus on optimizing the supply and distribution of motorcycle spare parts.
2.  **Workshop Establishment:** Prioritize the establishment and improvement of motorcycle repair and maintenance workshops.
3.  **Sales of Mid- to High-End Motorcycles:** Target these regions for the sale of premium and higher-priced motorcycle models.
4.  **Sales of Mid-Range Motorcycles and Below:** Focus on these areas for the sale of more affordable and entry-level motorcycle models.

## Data & Technologies Used

* **Data Source:** Demographics data scraped from trusted sites, such as Statistics Indonesia (BPS Indonesia)
* **Programming Language:** Python (likely for EDA, clustering, and evaluation).
* **Libraries (Expected):** `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn` (for clustering), `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (for visualization), etc.

# Region-Based Clustering for Upper Secondary School Recommendations in Indonesia

This project applies unsupervised learning (K-Means and K-Medoids) to cluster 514 cities and regencies in Indonesia using socioeconomic indicators. The goal is to support education policy by recommending whether regions are more suited for general (academic) or vocational secondary education.

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset used includes socioeconomic variables from 2019 to 2024.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Mount Google Drive
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

### 2. Load Data
```python
import pandas as pd
file_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/SKRIPSI-TA/SKRIPSI/data used/final_NO COR data_used_1622_revisi_bismillah.xlsx'
df = pd.read_excel(file_path)
df.drop(columns='Unnamed: 0', inplace=True)
```

---

## üìä Descriptive Statistics & Outlier Detection
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Example: Boxplot for one variable
var = 'PDRB ADHK (Rp)'
data = df[var]
plt.boxplot(data)
plt.title(f"Boxplot of {var}")
plt.show()

# Detect outliers
Q1 = data.quantile(0.25)
Q3 = data.quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
lower = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
outliers = df[(data < lower) | (data > upper)]
print(outliers[['provinsi', 'kota', var]])
```

## üîç K-Means Clustering

### Elbow Method
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
X = df.iloc[:, 3:]
distortions = []
for k in range(2, 10):
    km = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=99).fit(X)
    distortions.append(km.inertia_)

plt.plot(range(2, 10), distortions)
plt.title('Elbow Curve')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### Apply K-Means
```python
k = 5
km = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=99)
df['Cluster_KMeans'] = km.fit_predict(X)
```

### PCA Visualization
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)
df['PCA1'] = X_pca[:, 0]
df['PCA2'] = X_pca[:, 1]
sns.scatterplot(x='PCA1', y='PCA2', hue='Cluster_KMeans', data=df, palette='Set1')
plt.title('K-Means PCA Clusters')
plt.show()
```

    max_intra = max(np.max(distance_matrix[np.ix_(c, c)]) for c in clusters)
    min_inter = min(np.min(distance_matrix[np.ix_(c1, c2)]) for c1, c2 in combinations(clusters, 2))
    return min_inter / max_intra

# Example for KMeans
labels = df['Cluster_KMeans']
